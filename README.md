The sql folder contains a dump of the mysql database it will use. Your MAMP / WAMP / LAMP should be setup with a database called sun_in_the_city and a username root with password root. The sql folder will contain a dump of all the data that should be in it. Remove your database and then upload that one to restore it or upgrade it.
